# eBay Smart Buy - Books

It is a simple program which will allow one to scrap books data from eBay listings. This data may be useful for merchants who sell books on various online stores after purchasing used or new books from eBay on competitive prices. Data is exported in CSV file format with single book detail per line. It takes a file with ISBN10 or ISBN16 book codes with one ISBN per line as input.

## Application Features

* Search results with no book data can be excluded.

* Selection of eBay site to scrap data from i.e. US, Canada and UK.
* Filteration based on book price, seller feedback score and feedback percent.
* Restrict and/or allow data from selected sellers.
* Option to open eBay page from where data is scraped.
* Option to execute only unfinished and failed search queries.
